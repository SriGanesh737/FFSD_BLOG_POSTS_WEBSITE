    "title": "The FAA proposes lengthening cockpit voice recording time to 25 hours",
    "content": "The FAA said it is “initiating rulemaking that will require Cockpit Voice Recorders to capture 25 hours of information.” Currently, the cockpit voice recorder, which is one of two so-called “black boxes” on an aircraft, captures only the most recent two hours of sound in the cockpit.The rulemaking process can take multiple years, and the agency added it would welcome intervention from Congress on the matter. The FAA has previously said it did not pursue regulations in this area because it had other priorities.US airplane near misses keep coming. Now officials are talking about averting 'catastrophic' incidentsThe National Transportation Safety Board has said cockpit audio recordings are not available in all of the runway incursion incidents it is investigating because more than two hours passed before the recordings could be retrieved.The NTSB recommended the 25-hour standard after a 2017 incident where an airliner attempted to land on a runway occupied by several other aircraft at San Francisco International Airport. It said in its 2018 report that the lack of cockpit recordings hampered its investigation.The board has also identified more than a dozen other events since 2003 where investigators have been unable to listen to key audio because of the limited memory of the recorders.A litany of incidents – including violent turbulence that left passengers injured and a 2022 incident where an United Airlines Boeing 777 plunged toward the Pacific Ocean – prompted this week’s summit. And since the start of the year, there have been a troubling number of high-profile “near misses” as planes involved in airport landing or taking off procedures came perilously close to potential disaster.Following the summit, the FAA said they will also “establish an Aviation Rulemaking Committee to explore how to make greater use of data gathered by the airplane and its systems.”",

    'id': 'news_updates-2', "title": "TCS, Infosys, Wipro: How global banking woes may impact Indian IT companies",
    "content": 'The US banking, financial, services and insurance (BFSI) sectors is a key revenue segment for top Indian information technology (IT) companies and a banking crisis in the US and Europe will hurt inflows and growth in these firms, analysts believe.The IT companies such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, LTIMindtree, and Cognizant, which have high exposure to US banking institutions, may be impacted if the turmoil in the banking sector worsens.The BFSI contribution to the revenue of these IT companies is above 25 per cent, according to earnings reports.According to analysts, the collapse of large banking institutions may not only lead to a reduction in existing business but also trigger reduced tech spending in the future along with delayed deal closures.Impact on growth in 1HFY24 for Indian IT.The recent developments around bankruptcy of Silvergate, SVB and Signature Bank in the US and UBS-CS merger in Europe will likely impact growth for Indian IT in 1HFY24, and bring down overall growth for FY2024, said domestic brokerage house Kotak Institutional Equities.The brokerage believes TCS and Infosys are better positioned, whereas Wipro and Cognizant are vulnerable.It expects a growth slowdown in FY2024 to play out in the form of a weak March 2023 quarter, followed by a moderate uptick in 1QFY24 and normalisation in 2QFY24.Kotak believes there can a pause or slowdown in pace of digital/cloud programs due to cut in discretionary spending in the near term. Cut in discretionary spending will impact all companies.Lower exposure to BFS will reduce impact on HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra, the brokerage said, adding that higher focus on cost take-outs will generate opportunities in the form of application rationalization, higher offshoring, captive carve-outs, enabling automation and vendor consolidation.“TCS and Infosys are better positioned among Tier 1 IT. LTIM and Mphasis can benefit among mid-tier; the latter, however, will face near-term headwinds due to outsized exposure to BFS and significant exposure to the impacted mortgages sub-vertical," it said.The brokerage also said that CTSH and Wipro are vulnerable among Tier 1, higher consulting exposure increases vulnerability for the latter.“Caution among BFS firms in developed markets, following recent developments around bankruptcy of Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the US and UBS-CS merger in Europe will likely lead to further curtailing of discretionary tech spends in the near term," the note said.“Spending on cost take-outs will pick up, but will yield benefits in 2HFY24 or later," it said while expecting further polarisation of growth between winners and losers in FY2024.“Current woes in the banking sector can impact sequential growth by 1-2% in 1QFY24. This assumes quick resolution to the global banking crisis and problems remaining localized to BFS. Our current growth forecast for leaders, viz, for FY2024E, stands at 8%, which may get impacted by 1-2% due to the current crisis. A full-blown recession will have a bigger impact," it said.BFS exposureAccording to Kotak, BFS exposure, excluding insurance, for TCS stands at 29 per cent, CTSH at 19 per cent, Infosys at 26 per cent, Wipro at 27 per cent, HCLT at 14 per cent and TM 12 per cent.Europe BFSI exposure for Infosys, Wipro and CTSH stood at 4.9 per cent, 11.7 per cent and 6.2%, respectively. The brokerage estimates TCS Europe exposure at 13 per cent.',

    "content": "India was the 12th largest consumer of bottled water by value and the 14th biggest by volume in 2021, shows a new United Nations report released ahead of World Water Day on 22 March. In the mineral water segment, the country reported the second fastest growth rate after South Korea in the three years from 2018 to 2021, the report said.India’s bottled mineral water market grew 27% per year during the period, while South Korea’s grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 28%. Mineral water is one of the most prevalent types of bottled water which is sourced from underground reservoirs.The US, China and Indonesia were the three largest markets overall, accounting for nearly 40% of the total global sales of 350 billion litres in 2021. The global market was worth an estimated $270 billion that year and is expected to increase to $500 billion between 2025 and 2030, says the report. The paper was published by the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH), a UN think tank on water.Treated water is the most popular bottled water market by volume, making up 47% of the total. This is water that is treated and disinfected before being consumed. This category is dominated by developing countries, including India. Mineral water comes next, with a 33% share. The remaining covers bottled water from other natural sources (20%).",
